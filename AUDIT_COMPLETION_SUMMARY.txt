  - File structure analysis
  - Manual code review
  - Accessibility calculation (contrast ratios)
  - Touch target size calculation

  • Be ready for app store submission

With all Phase 1-3 fixes (6+ hours), the app would:
  • Achieve 9.5/10 design maturity
  • Have dark mode support
  • Have Dynamic Type accessibility
  • Be a modern, polished product

Confidence Level: HIGH
All findings are backed by code review with specific file locations and line
numbers. All fixes are documented with exact code changes needed.
